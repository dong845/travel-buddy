"""Deterministic consistency lint for a Travel Buddy Discovery shortlist.

Discovery was the half of this skill with no gate at all. Construction has nineteen checks plus an
HTML validator; templates/destination-evaluation.json was referenced only in SKILL.md prose, and no
script read it. Every rule about comparability, evidence and the hard-filter ordering lived in
sentences, which is the exact configuration this project has learned fails silently.

A shortlist is a COMPARISON, so its worst defects live BETWEEN candidates rather than inside one.
Each record can be individually impeccable and the ranking still be meaningless -- one figure per
person beside another for the whole party, or one covering flights only beside one covering
everything. Nothing inside a single candidate can detect that, which is why these checks read the
set.

What this deliberately does NOT do: judge whether evidence is sufficient, whether a score is
deserved, or whether a destination is a good idea. Those need a reader. This decides only what
arithmetic and set membership can decide, and says so rather than implying more.
