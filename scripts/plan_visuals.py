"""Inline SVG figures drawn from the plan's own numbers.

Why these and not decoration. The delivered page is 96KB of text with zero images and zero
figures, and the things hardest to see in it are the things a traveller most needs to judge:
whether a day is a tight cluster or spread across a city, which day is the heavy one for their
legs, where the money went, and how packed each day is. All four are already IN the plan as
numbers. Nothing had to be researched, licensed, downloaded or invented to draw them -- which is
also why they are separate from the photo tier: a figure derived from the plan cannot be wrong
about the trip in a way the plan is not already wrong, and it costs no network and no bytes.

Every figure here obeys the same four rules, and the first is a scar:

1. **Scale, never truncate.** The route diagram used to be a horizontal SVG needing ~720px to stay
   legible, so on a phone it silently showed the first two stops of the day and looked complete.
   Everything here uses a viewBox with no minimum width, so a narrow screen shrinks the figure
   instead of cropping it.
2. **Degrade to nothing, never to a lie.** A figure with no data returns "" and the page simply
   has one less figure. An axis with invented numbers would be worse than an absent chart.
3. **No renderer-owned English.** Callers pass their own labels, because validate_trip_html.py
   fails any non-English page carrying renderer English -- and an SVG's text nodes are exactly as
   visible as a paragraph's.
4. **Print and screen-reader safe.** Figures carry a title and text alternatives, and use stroke
   plus shape rather than colour alone to distinguish series.
