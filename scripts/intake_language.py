"""Which language the intake pages speak -- decided once, here, for every script that asks.

The profile collects `identity_and_language.preferred_response_language`, and until 2026-09-24
nothing downstream read it: the trip form received it and dropped it, 0 of 15 real intakes carried
it, and every page was Chinese. The order of sources is the spec's (decision 2): an explicit
`--language`, else the saved profile's preferred output language, else Chinese.

The profile stores the traveller's own words for that preference ("中文", "English",
"中文和 English", "其他"), so they are normalised here rather than compared anywhere else. A
bilingual or unrecognised answer names no single page language and resolves to the next source.

Two additions from a generality pass on 2026-09-24. A profile written in chat, by whichever
assistant, says "en_US", "English (UK)" or "Simplified Chinese" rather than the dropdown's words,
and each of those fell through to Chinese; locale tags and language names are now read too. And a
traveller who switched the profile page to English but left the preference blank -- or chose
"other" -- had every trip form open in Chinese, although the page they used was the answer; the
profile now records `identity_and_language.profile_form_language`, consulted after the preference.
