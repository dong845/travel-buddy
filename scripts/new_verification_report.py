"""A correctly-shaped verification report to fill in, instead of one to guess at.

Usage: python new_verification_report.py --from-plan <plan.json> [--out <report.json>]

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured on the author's own workspace. Seventeen delivered plans, and the
verification stage -- the most expensive thing this skill asks for, and the one it argues hardest
for -- has never left a surviving artifact behind. Six plans claim `verification_status: verified`;
four of them point at report files that no longer exist, two of those into a session scratchpad
that is deleted when the session ends. Nothing was lazy about that. `new_plan_skeleton.py` exists
because starting a plan from a blank file cost one measured run three round trips and twenty-one
structural errors, and the report is the harder document of the two: seven blocks, a tier the plan
computes rather than the author choosing, and a coverage rule that demands a pointer for every
dining card claiming researched hours. The only guide was the gate telling you what was wrong after
you guessed.

So this emits the shape, bound to the plan, with the pointers already derived and CHECKED to
resolve -- and with every conclusion left as a `TODO:`, because a scaffold for an evidence document
is one wrong step from a forgery generator. `check_plan_consistency.check_verification` refuses a
report still carrying placeholder text, which is what makes this safe to hand to an author: an
unfilled report cannot be delivered, in the same way an unfilled plan cannot be rendered.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It does not verify anything, and it cannot: every `claims_checked` entry it
writes is a pointer at a claim somebody still has to go and check. The pointer says where to look.
