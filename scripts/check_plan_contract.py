"""Every wrong field name in the plan, in one pass, with the name it was probably meant to be.

Usage: python check_plan_contract.py <plan.json> [--json]

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured on one real Construction run. Building a plan by hand cost thirteen
round trips to the gates, and not one of them was about the trip: they were field names.
`total_duration_minutes` for `duration_minutes`. `url` for `search_url`. `provider` for
`platform`. `amount_low` for `per_person_low`. `total_low` for `estimated_per_person_low`.
`day_number` for `planned_day`. An `outbound_itinerary` written as a sentence where the contract
wants an object of six fields.

Each one cost a full cycle -- edit, run the gate, read a fresh batch of errors -- because the
gates validate by subject and stop at the first category that fails, which is right for THEM: a
plan whose budget does not add up should not also be lectured about map links. It is wrong for the
author, who could have fixed all thirteen in one edit if anything had told them all thirteen.

So this is not a gate. It answers one question the gates deliberately do not: **is every key in
this document a key the contract knows?** It runs before them, costs no network, and its output is
a worklist rather than a verdict. A misspelling is nearly always a near-miss, so each unknown key
is reported with the closest contract key -- "you wrote X, the contract says Y" is a fix; "unknown
key X" is a search.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. It knows nothing about whether the plan is true, feasible, or internally
consistent -- `check_plan_consistency.py` owns all of that and this file must never grow into it.
It also cannot tell a typo from a field somebody added on purpose, so an unrecognised key is
reported as a question, not an error, and the keys the skill's own scripts write are known to it.

# CLOSED VOCABULARIES, read from the renderer rather than restated here.
#
# WHY THIS WAS ADDED, measured on one real Construction run. This script printed "CONTRACT OK:
# every key in plan.json is one templates/final-trip-plan.json declares" -- and the very next
# command, render_final_trip_html.py, rejected the same file with **fourteen** findings. Every one
# of them was a closed enum's VALUE or a required field, not a key name: `plan_status`,
# `price_basis`, `ticket_status`, `price_status`, an anchor's `neighborhood_or_area`, the
# transport_overview map fields. So the author got two separate "here is everything at once"
# passes, which is the same round trip this file was written to delete, one level down.
#
# The values could not be learned from the template either: it writes free text as `null` on
# purpose, so `price_status`, `availability_status` and `ticket_status` all read as "no value" and
# teach nothing. A sibling template, destination-evaluation.json, carries an `_enums` block for
# exactly this reason; final-trip-plan.json had none.
#
# The vocabularies are IMPORTED, never copied. Two hand-maintained lists drift, and this
# repository has already paid for that once: a hand-written list of renderer-owned English strings
# went stale beside the renderer's own substitution table, and a Chinese page shipped carrying
# English. One definition, in the module that enforces it.
