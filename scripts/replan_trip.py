"""Move an existing Travel Buddy plan onto new dates, a new party size, or a new budget cap.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`references/research-budget.md` records the incident this script is built around: a measured run
moved the travel window by **one day**, the weekday map was redone by hand, and that manual redo
introduced an off-by-one in every ticket `day_number` and every anchor `planned_day`. The skill
wrote the lesson down and then shipped no tool for it, so the next date change was going to be
done by hand too.

Dates are the dangerous delta because almost every fact researched under a day is keyed to a
*weekday* rather than to a date: opening hours, closure days, market days, Sunday retail law, a
museum that shuts Mondays. Shift the window by one day and all of it quietly becomes a guess while
the plan still looks complete, still renders, and still passes every structural gate.

So this script splits the work at the only line that can be drawn safely:

  * **Rewritten mechanically** — everything that is a pure function of the shift: the trip window,
    every `days[].date`, day numbering, accommodation `check_in`/`check_out`, dated booking fields,
    and the trip dates prefilled into booking URLs. Code cannot get these wrong; a human redoing
    them by hand demonstrably can.
  * **Flagged, never rewritten** — every sentence. "Saturday is the only full shopping day of the
    trip" becomes false when the dates move, and silently swapping the weekday token inside it
    would turn a stale sentence into a confident lie, which is worse than a stale one because it
    reads as freshly checked. Each one lands in `replan_context.must_reverify`, and
    `check_plan_consistency.py` refuses the plan until every entry is resolved.

It also clears `verification_status` and drops `verification_report`, because a plan whose dates
moved was never verified on those dates -- the old report certified a different calendar.

Usage:
    python scripts/replan_trip.py <plan.json> --shift-days 1 --out <new.json>
    python scripts/replan_trip.py <plan.json> --start 2026-10-02 --end 2026-10-05
    python scripts/replan_trip.py <plan.json> --travellers 2 --cap 950 --out <new.json>

The new plan goes to --out, or to stdout when --out is absent. The change log -- what changed,
what was retained, what must be re-verified -- always goes to stderr, so `> new.json` still works.

Read references/replanning.md before using the output.
