# Where the rule is written
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file had more places it can refuse a page than any gate but the renderer, and ZERO
# mentions of `references/` -- the worst ratio of the four gates. It is also the gate whose messages are shortest: "Map links must
# declare data-map-kind=directions." is nineteen findings on the real workspace and tells a reader
# nothing about where that attribute is specified, what else travels with it, or why it exists.
#
# The rule those nineteen findings break is written in references/booking-html-output.md, the
# largest file in the reference layer -- about a third of it -- and whose only trigger in
# SKILL.md is one sentence inside its longest paragraph. A run on a non-Claude-Code CLI that never
# opened it -- which is how this skill is actually used, on Chinese-provider models -- is told
# nineteen times that something is missing and never once where to look. Naming the section turns
# that into a loop that closes, and it loads that reference only for the run that has already
# proved it needs it.
#
# Sibling of check_plan_consistency.py's registry, and the same three rules apply: APPEND so the
# substring assertions in tests/ keep matching, derive the anchor from the enforcing code rather
# than from SKILL.md's description of it, and cite the RULE rather than the file. What differs is
# the mechanism. There it is a decorator, because the rules are one-per-function and a decorator
# covers branches nobody has written yet. Here every rule lives inside one `validate()` and one
# parser class, so there is no function boundary to decorate and the citation goes on the call.
# The cost of that is real and worth stating: a NEW `errors.append` added to validate() later will
# ship uncited, and nothing here will notice. tests/test_packaging.py checks that the anchors that
# ARE emitted resolve; it cannot check for the citation somebody did not write.
#
# That last paragraph is no longer true, and it is left standing because it is the reason the fix
# exists. tests/test_packaging.py now takes an AST census of every error-append site in this file
# and in render_final_trip_html.py: a site whose argument is not a cite(...) call must be declared
# in SITES_WITHOUT_A_REFERENCE below, keyed by enclosing function and counted. An uncited
# `errors.append` added to validate() now fails that test instead of shipping quietly.

# Why the two tuples above are not enough, and what replaces them.
#
# Both are DENY-LISTS: they fail English that somebody remembered to write down. Everything else
# is invisible to them, and "everything else" is not hypothetical. A source's `confidence` was
# printed as visible text for the entire life of the feature -- the renderer's own fallback was
# the bare word "researched" and the stored values were "high"/"medium"/"low" -- and three
# DELIVERED Chinese pages shipped it while this file printed `VALID: booking-ready HTML structure
# passed.` The same sweep found the day-route mode leaking `public-transit` onto every Chinese
# itinerary this skill has ever produced, because RENDERER_ENGLISH_MARKUP's pattern for that
# shape spells the heading `<h2>` and the day card uses `<h3>`. One character.
#
# Appending "high|medium|low" to the list would fix the reported defect and reproduce the design
# that caused it. What follows is the structural half. None of it needs a human to remember
# anything, and all of its vocabulary is READ FROM THE RENDERER rather than copied here:
#
#   renderer_owned_english()      the renderer's OWN table of translatable strings. A caption or
#                                 banner added to static_replacements tomorrow is checked here
#                                 today. ERROR.
#   untranslated_enum_segments()  a visible value that stands alone between the renderer's own
#                                 middot separators and is exactly a member of an enum the
#                                 renderer declares. This is the one that catches an ALREADY
#                                 DELIVERED page: it needs no cooperation from the markup, which
#                                 pages rendered before enum_cell() existed cannot give. ERROR.
#   untranslated_enum_cells()     an element whose rendered text is still the machine token in its
#                                 own data- attribute. No vocabulary at all, so it covers a value
#                                 whose enum is declared nowhere. ERROR.
#   machine_identifiers()         snake_case tokens in visible text, which are not words in any
#                                 language. NOTE, not error -- its own docstring says why, and
#                                 what has to change for it to be promoted.
#
# WHAT THEY STILL CANNOT SEE, stated plainly so nobody mistakes this for a solved problem:
#   * A new single-word English string hard-coded straight into the markup and never added to
#     static_replacements. Nothing in a rendered page distinguishes it from an author's own word.
#     The renderer's defence against that is static_replacements' docstring rule -- every
#     renderer-owned string goes in that table -- and this file now enforces the table, not a copy
#     of it.
#   * A new enum that is neither declared as a renderer constant NOR emitted with its machine
#     token in a data- attribute. enum_cell() in the renderer exists to make the second one the
#     easy path; markup hand-written around a bare value stays invisible, exactly as `confidence`
#     was for the whole life of the feature.
#   * A machine value that a reader could mistake for a word: an enum member spelled as ordinary
#     prose would pass both enum checks by looking like text, which is the trade that keeps them
#     from failing an author's own sentence.
#   * A mistranslation. Every check here asks "is this still the machine/English form", never "is
#     this the right words".

    """Every value the renderer declares as a closed enum, read from the renderer's constants.

    Used to decide whether an element printing its own machine token is a LEAK or just an author
    writing a short lowercase word. `days[].route.mode` is the case that forces the distinction:
    it is free text by contract and real delivered plans write 「地铁」 and 「步行 + KTEL 东岸公交」
    into it, while other plans paste the machine enum `public-transit` and ship it to a Chinese
    reader on every day card. Same markup, same attribute; only membership in TRANSPORT_MODES
    tells them apart.

    Reflection rather than a copied list, for the reason this whole section exists: a tuple added
    to the renderer next year is covered without anybody editing this file.

    WHICH tuples, though, used to be decided by subtracting NOT_VISIBLE_ENUM_CONSTANTS -- an
    exclusion list, so a constant of ordinary English words was enum vocabulary until somebody
    remembered to write its name down, and three sets of search-URL parameter names never were.
    The property is positive now: a constant counts when the renderer USES IT AS A VALUE DOMAIN,
    testing a value for membership in it. That is not a proxy for "closed enum a plan field may
    hold" -- it is the definition. This file already says so one function down, where
    machine_identifiers() explains that `source_type` and `traveler_basis` stay notes rather than
    errors precisely because nothing validates them. An enum the renderer does not enforce is not
    closed, and its values are not this gate's business.

    The asymmetry the old comment wanted is preserved and strengthened: a new enum is covered the
    day the renderer starts validating against it, with no edit here, and a new vocabulary of
    field names, CSS classes or provider ids is excluded with no edit here either.

    WHAT THIS STILL CANNOT SEE, plainly, because a check whose blind spots are unwritten is how
    the last three got in:

      * A membership test whose tested value is not a plan field. DISALLOWED_URL_QUERY_KEYS is
        the one, and it is named in NOT_VISIBLE_ENUM_CONSTANTS with that reason.
      * Membership resolved deeper than one call. If a helper hands a constant to another helper
        that does the `in`, the constant drops out and its enum silently stops being checked.
      * A constant passed to such a helper by KEYWORD rather than by position.
      * An enum reached only through an attribute (`renderer.FOO`) or built into a dict, since
        pass 2 matches bare Names in call arguments.
      * An enum the renderer prints but never validates -- deliberately, per the paragraph above.

    Returns (values, failure). `failure` is non-empty when the renderer's source could not be
    read or parsed, and the caller turns it into an error: this reflection now depends on the
    source file and not only on the import, which is a new way for the gate to go quiet, and a
    check that vanishes while the report still ends in VALID is the failure mode this whole
    section exists to answer.

    A finding tells an author WHAT is wrong on a page that runs to hundreds of kilobytes; the

    -- getpos() is the position of the construct being handled -- so it is read off the parser at
    append time rather than reconstructed afterwards by searching the page for a string, which
    would find the first of several identical buttons as often as the right one.

    Line AND column, because line alone is a false comfort here: render_final_trip_html.py emits
    the whole body as one line, so a delivered page in this workspace is a few dozen short lines
    and one that is almost all of it, and three findings about three different buttons all reported
    "line 32". The column is what makes the answer narrower than the document.

    None is the honest answer for a finding raised after the page was parsed ("8 of 8 dining cards
    print no rating line" is about the whole document) and for one about markup that is missing
    altogether, which by definition has no position. The caller prints null rather than a guess.

    #
    # The note stayed a note for one run too long. "A page presented as the finished plan" was

    # in `notes`, the script printed "VALID: booking-ready HTML structure passed." and exited 0,
    # and a hand-assembled page was green on the only gate that could ever have seen it.

    # delivering it, not sketching it, and a delivery with no stamp means every gate in this
    # skill was skipped on the artifact the traveller books from. A draft render passes no plan
    # and still gets the note, unchanged, because rendering a draft directly is legitimate.
    #
    # SUPERSEDED, and kept because it records what the argument above believed. Promoting this to
    # an error under `--plan` was tried and reverted, for two measured reasons that point the same
    # way. It fired on legitimate work: `render_final_trip_html.py` -- this repository's own
    # renderer, and the command SKILL.md tells you to iterate with -- emits no stamp, so the
    # documented pre-delivery loop failed on its own output, and all fifteen delivered pages in a
    # real workspace failed on a stamp that postdates them. And it proved nothing anyway: the stamp
    # is rendered out of `plan["gates_passed"]["checks"]`, a key an author types. A hand-assembled
    # plan carrying `"gates_passed": {"checks": 24}` and `"verification_status": "verified"`, run
    # through the renderer -- which enforces no consistency, no intake provenance and no
    # verification -- came out stamped, unbannered and VALID. A marker copied from the artifact it
    # is meant to vouch for is not provenance.
    #
    # So this stays a note, and the real signal stays where it already was: the `Plan JSON:` and
