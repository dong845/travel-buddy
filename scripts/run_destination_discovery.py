    run -- already has something driving it, and a second planner there is the defect this whole
    module is about.

    That case has to be recognised POSITIVELY. The previous version tested for it by listing the
    assistants it knew (CLAUDECODE, CLAUDE_CODE, CODEX_THREAD_ID) and treating anything else as a
    bare terminal, which quietly made every other harness -- Gemini CLI, Cursor, Copilot CLI,
    opencode, an SDK agent -- fall through to the spawn branch and start a detached Codex behind
    an assistant that was already planning the same trip. A denylist of assistant names can only
    ever be as current as the day it was written; "did a human open this terminal" does not go
    stale. Both stdin and stdout are checked because a harness that pipes only one of them is
    still not a person at a keyboard.

    Residual gap, stated rather than hidden: a harness that allocates a full pty looks like a
    terminal here. The env markers above catch the two we know, and --assistant none or
    TRAVEL_BUDDY_ASSISTANT=none is the explicit escape for the rest.

The HTML must contain a timed, geographically coherent itinerary, two-to-three comparable hotels in each stay group unless one has a researched reason, concrete flight legs and normally two candidates when flying, specific meal cards, destination-experience anchors, booking/ticket/rental links where relevant, a transparent per-person cost breakdown, source register, and caveats. Every price needs a basis, status, and check time. A round-trip flight button must prefill origin, destination, both dates, and travellers; a hotel comparison button must prefill destination, dates, guests, and rooms. Every route segment must name one primary mode plus service/instructions, walking/transfers, fare basis and fallback; its map button must be an actual directions URL, never a POI page. Label any start/end-only link as a route overview, never a full-day route, and make the segment buttons the navigation source of truth. For mainland China, use a researched Amap `uri.amap.com/navigation` link with `from`, `to`, and `mode`. Treat a final departure day as checkout/no overnight stay rather than an extra hotel night.

Do not ask the traveller to repeat information already in those files and do not ask them to type \"continue\". Respect excluded places, regional service access, and all privacy rules. Read `trip_geography.scope`: for `domestic`, stay within the traveller’s domestic market and do not ask for or infer entry requirements; for `cross_border` or `domestic_or_cross_border`, apply the saved per-traveller entry constraints. Treat high-speed rail, conventional/night rail, intercity bus, ferry, flights, and self-drive as distinct transport modes; do not silently reduce rail/bus preferences to a flight-only search. The saved budget range uses `calculation_basis: per_person`: preserve that basis in comparisons and final HTML, and label any party total as a separate derived calculation. Use current, source-labeled research for volatile claims. Do not make purchases, log in, submit forms, or request credentials/payment/document data.

Resolve all choices in this order: (1) an explicit value in this current-trip intake, including selected trip geography and transport modes; (2) a compatible stable default from the reusable profile only where the current-trip field is empty or unspecified; (3) destination-market feasibility from current research. Never infer domestic versus cross-border scope from nationality, residence, language, or currency: the current `trip_geography.scope` is authoritative. If that selected scope conflicts with a named destination, explain the conflict and ask the smallest clarification instead of silently changing scope. Use profile exclusions as hard filters and visited/revisit settings as diversity rules, but let any current-trip override win. Use the selected transport modes to decide which comparisons and booking branches to research; apply a saved self-drive/cabin preference only as a tie-breaker when it does not conflict with this trip’s explicit choice. Select maps, booking platforms, and local operators by the actual destination/route market plus the traveller’s declared normal service access, not merely by the profile’s usual app.
