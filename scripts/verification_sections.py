"""Which parts of a plan a verification pass covered, fingerprinted so a later edit is visible.

A verified plan edited afterwards used to keep its verified status: the report bound the plan by
file name and date, never by content. Measured 2026-09-24 on a copy of the one verified real plan
in the author's workspace: a day's 13:30 moved to 14:00, re-saved with the same report -- saved, no
banner, and the page printed 14:00 under a verification that never saw it.

The fingerprint is per SECTION rather than per file, and that is the design decision, not a detail.
A whole-file fingerprint would close the hole by making every edit cost the full seven-block pass
again -- which is exactly what a traveller asking to swap one dinner should not have to buy. Per
section, the gate can say which part moved, the verifier can recheck that part alone, and every
other part keeps the verification it already has.

Sections are keyed by identity, not by position: a day by its date, a booking option by its id,
every other content block by its name. Reordering the hotels, or inserting a day, therefore changes
only what actually changed. Keys the skill's own scripts write -- the verification status, the gate
stamp, the imagery sidecar name, this receipt -- describe the run rather than the trip, and are
never part of a fingerprint.
