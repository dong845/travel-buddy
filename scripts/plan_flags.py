"""The HTML gate settings, derived from the plan instead of chosen by hand.

Every setting in this file used to be a command-line flag a model picked per run, and four of
them defaulted to off. `validate_trip_html.py page.html` printed "VALID: booking-ready HTML
structure passed." and exited 0 with the day-count check, the booking-type check, the car-link
rule and the "not fact-checked" banner check all disarmed at once -- and an exit 0 is what an
assistant reads. Worse, three of the four were derivable from JSON keys SKILL.md never names
(trip.arrival_transport_mode, booking_options.attraction_tickets, booking_options.ground_transport),
so arming them by hand required knowing to go looking for fields no document mentions. The banner
flag was never named in a single .md file in this repository.

This module is the one definition of that derivation. It lives in its own file rather than in
either caller because save_trip_deliverables.py already does
`from validate_trip_html import validate as validate_html` -- so putting the helper in
save_trip_deliverables.py and importing it from validate_trip_html.py is an import cycle, and the
failure would land on whoever ran the validator directly, as an ImportError out of a
half-initialised module rather than anything about travel plans. save_trip_deliverables.py's own
comment on the booking-type list already called it "the same list, kept in step by hand in three
files". This is the file where it stops being three.

Everything here refuses loudly. A deriver that quietly substitutes a plausible default for a
malformed plan rebuilds the exact defect it was written to delete: the old flags were dangerous
precisely because "nobody said anything" and "nothing is required here" were indistinguishable
from outside. A plan this module cannot read is a plan whose gate settings nobody knows, and that
has to look different from a plan that needs no gates.

# disk. It matters more than it looks. validate_trip_html.py keys BOTH car rules off equality with
# these two strings -- self-drive requires a rental-car link, public-transit forbids one -- so a

# safer because only one rule keys off it -- and that is exactly what makes it worse. A wrong value
# here does not turn a rule off in a way anyone notices; it answers "does this trip need a flight
# booking card?" with "no", which is the same answer a rail trip gives. Measured: with the bare
# `== "flight"` test, a flight plan written "air", "Flight" or "" derived `hotel` alone, the
# flight-link check never ran, and the page printed VALID carrying no flight card at all. The
