"""Validate and save a Travel Buddy plan JSON plus its rendered HTML locally.

Usage: python save_trip_deliverables.py <plan.json|-> [--workspace PATH] [--slug NAME] [--overwrite]

`-` reads the plan from standard input, and a plan whose photographs live in a sidecar should be
passed BY PATH instead. `imagery_sidecar` is a name relative to the plan (fetch_plan_imagery.py
gives the reasoning), and a plan piped in has no location for it to be relative to -- so the name
gets resolved against whatever directory the command happened to run from. Measured both ways:
`cat plan.json | python scripts/save_trip_deliverables.py -` exited 2 for every photographed plan
run from an ordinary cwd, and when that cwd happened to hold a file of the same name from a
different trip it delivered THAT trip's photograph, with its photographer and licence printed
underneath. The resolver now refuses the second case outright and the first case names the remedy,
which is this line: give it the path.
