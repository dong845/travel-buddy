# read it, and that changes what it is: a single-use credential at rest, in the traveller's own
# workspace, one directory above their saved profile. The first version of this mode wrote it with
# whatever the umask allowed -- measured at 0644, `-rw-r--r--`, world-readable -- and never removed
# it. Two runs against one workspace therefore left two files, the older naming a server that had
# been dead for hours, and every later run added another. That is the opposite of what SKILL.md's
# profile rules and references/profile-and-storage.md promise about this skill's local storage:
# traveller data is written deliberately and narrowly, never incidentally and never left lying
# around. A caller told to read `<workspace>/.intake-<port>.url` and globbing `.intake-*.url` picks

    """Start an intake server in the background when the harness itself cannot background it.

    The defect this exists for: opencode, Cursor, Cline and Codex offer no non-blocking command
    primitive, and this script's only mode was subprocess.run(), which blocks in serve_forever()
    for the minutes a traveller spends filling the form. The link therefore never reached the
    traveller at all, and the harness's command timeout eventually killed the server mid-fill.
    A model in that position has no honest exit: `intake_context.method: html_form` needs the
    intake file the blocked server never wrote, and `chat_fallback` needs `declined_verbatim` --
    the traveller's own words declining the form -- which they never said, because they were
    never offered it. render_final_trip_html.py and save_trip_deliverables.py both require one
    of those, correctly and with no bypass, so the remaining moves were to invent a quote or to
    abandon the save. That is the mechanism by which trip details went unexecuted on those
    harnesses: not a missing rule, a missing verb.

    So the parent does the waiting instead of the caller: it starts the child in its own session,
    polls until the child's port actually answers, writes the link and PID where they can be read
    later, prints both, and exits 0 within seconds. Everything the server says from then on --
    including the `TRAVEL BUDDY TRIP INPUT: <path>` sentinel that arrives minutes later, and the
    chained current-trip URL when the profile form hands over -- keeps streaming into the log
    file, which is what the caller polls in place of a live pipe.
