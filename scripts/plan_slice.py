"""Project a plan down to what ONE verification domain reads, before the fan-out.

references/verification.md sends five truth-domain verifiers at the same file: "Each verifier gets
the plan path and this instruction." Five agents then read one plan five times. Measured on
2026-08-30 over the 15 plans in a real workspace, that file is 28,943 bytes at the smallest,
85,836 at the median and 2,132,252 at the largest, and references/research-budget.md prices the
full verification pass at ~700k tokens -- so the re-reads are a real line in that budget, and on
the largest plan they are the dominant one. This script hands each domain a projection instead.

WHAT THIS IS NOT, because the obvious version of it is wrong and was refuted three times.

The five domains are not a partition of the plan's fields, and the prose table in
verification.md is not a schema. `booking_and_lodging` is told to answer "for every ticket a day
actually schedules, when do the seats go on sale, and where does the plan have the traveller at
that moment?" -- which needs `days`. `entry` must check transit visas for the actual connection
airports, which are in the itinerary and the flight cards, not in `entry_context`. `seasonality`
must check daylight against scheduled times, which is `days`. An allow-list built from the table's
prose would take exactly those fields away, and each of them is where a measured trip-breaking
defect lived.

So this is a SUBTRACTIVE deny list. Every slice keeps `trip`, `days` and `budget` unconditionally;
a block is dropped from a domain only when that domain's duties cannot be expressed by any field
in it, and every drop carries the reason in IRRELEVANT_TO below. A top-level key this file has
never heard of is KEPT and reported, which is the whole reason to write the rule subtractively:
an allow-list silently starves a domain when the schema grows, and a deny list only gets less
efficient. tests/test_plan_slice.py pins the two tables to templates/final-trip-plan.json, so a
key added to the contract fails that test until somebody classifies it -- and while nobody has,
the key travels with every slice rather than disappearing from all five.

Accept the smaller saving. The big blocks are mostly kept, on purpose, and
KEPT_EVERYWHERE_BECAUSE records why for each one -- that dict is the argument, not decoration.

THE AUDITORS ARE OUT OF SCOPE. `consistency` and `completeness` check the plan against ITSELF:
which stated preference is served only by a token anchor, whether a day's pacing is physically
plausible, which collected field never reaches the page. Every one of those questions is a
comparison between two parts of the plan, so removing either part does not make the auditor
cheaper, it makes it wrong. They get the whole plan, and passing their names as --domain is
refused with that reason rather than with an argparse usage line.

Pointers survive. check_plan_consistency requires every `claims_checked` entry to resolve against
the real plan, so a projection that renumbered a list or flattened a block would make a verifier's
honest citation fail the gate. This slices by top-level key only: kept blocks are the same objects
in the same order, so `days[2].dining[1].venue_hours` means the same thing in the slice as in the
plan, and the only pointers that stop resolving are the ones rooted at a key this file printed as
dropped.

Usage:
    python scripts/plan_slice.py <plan.json> --domain entry
    python scripts/plan_slice.py <plan.json> --domain seasonality --out /tmp/seasonality.json
    python scripts/plan_slice.py <plan.json> --domain transport --stdout | pbcopy

The slice is written to `slices/<plan-stem>.slice-<domain>.json` beside the plan -- a
subdirectory, because audit_workspace.py recognises a plan by its shape over a non-recursive
plans/*.json glob and would audit a slice sitting in there as an itinerary. What was dropped is
BOTH printed and recorded inside the file, so the projection is an artifact somebody can check
rather than a stderr line nobody keeps. It is written in the plan's own indentation, so the
saving printed on the summary line is a saving in the file a verifier actually opens.
