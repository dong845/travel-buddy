"""Emit a structurally valid final-trip-plan skeleton, so authoring fills content not structure.

Usage:
  python new_plan_skeleton.py --start 2026-09-11 --end 2026-09-14 \
      --origin "阿姆斯特丹" --destination "马拉加" --language zh --currency EUR \
      --travellers 1 --mode public-transit --stops-per-day 4 > plan.json

  python new_plan_skeleton.py --from-intake <workspace>/plans/intake-<stamp>-<slug>.json > plan.json

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`templates/final-trip-plan.json` lists every field but cannot express the rules that relate them,
so an author discovers those by failing the renderer. Measured on one real run, the first render
returned 21 errors and every one was structural, not factual:

  * segments must mirror consecutive pairs in stops_in_order, exactly, by string equality --
    a stop written "老城 Calle Larios 街区" and a segment ending "老城 Calle Larios 街区（午餐）"
    is a mismatch;
  * `service_or_line` must be non-empty even on a walking leg;
  * booking-access categories are `attraction_ticket` / `rail_or_ground`, not the budget
    spellings `attractions` / `local_transport`;
  * a departure day still needs a breakfast card;
  * two flight candidates must not share a review_url.

Three edit-render round-trips went into rediscovering that. This script encodes it once: the
skeleton it prints renders on the first try, so the whole of that loop is spent on facts.

IT CANNOT BE SHIPPED HALF-FILLED
--------------------------------
Free-text values an author must supply are the string "TODO: ...". Those survive rendering --
the renderer only requires fields to be non-empty -- and are then rejected by
`validate_trip_html.py`, which fails any page still carrying a TODO. So the skeleton speeds up
authoring without becoming a way to deliver a hollow page.

Typed fields cannot hold that prose, so they take type-valid sentinels. URLs keep the property:
https://example.invalid/TODO-... is HTTPS enough for the renderer, still trips the TODO scan,
and can never resolve, so `check_link_targets.py` objects too. Dates do not: 1970-01-01 is
conspicuous on the page but no gate rejects it. Neither does `on_foot_minutes: 0`, which is
indistinguishable from an author who measured the day and found no walking in it. Those two are
the holes in this design, and they are stated rather than papered over -- check every
`checked_at`, and every activity's on-foot minutes, before delivery.

--from-intake
-------------
The traveller already answered these questions once. Copying their answers by hand is where they
get lost: the measured run planned from the wrong origin city and a superseded budget cap while
both sat correct in the intake file, and `budget.cap_per_person` -- hardcoded None here until now
-- meant the cap-overrun check silently passed every skeleton-produced plan, so nothing objected.
`--from-intake` copies the mapped fields and prints every one of them to stderr, because a copy
nobody sees is how the wrong city survived a whole planning run. Command-line flags still win: an
operator naming a value on the command line is correcting the file, which is the one case where
the file is not the authority.
