"""Regression tests for the budget-figure half of scripts/render_final_trip_html.py.

`validate_trip_html.py` fails a non-English page that prints renderer-owned English, and that
gate is what caught the original defect: the budget breakdown table read "市内交通: €47–62"
while the chart directly above it read "local_transport 54" -- the same fact, in two languages,
because `budget_bar()` was handed raw category keys.

The repair is a rewrite pass over generated markup, which is the kind of thing that works on the
page it was written against and quietly damages the next one. Both directions are asserted here:
the figure must be translated, and everything outside it must not be.

Network-free by construction.
