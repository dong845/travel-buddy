"""A verification covers the content it read, and an edit afterwards is rechecked by section.

The report used to bind a plan by file name and date only. Measured 2026-09-24 on a copy of the one
verified real plan: day 3 moved from 13:30 to 14:00, re-saved with the same report, saved, no
banner, and the page showed 14:00 under a verification that never saw it. The owner chose the
section design over "any change voids the report": a verified save stamps a fingerprint per
section -- each day by its date, each booking option by its id, each other block -- and a later
save against the same report must recheck exactly the sections that changed. Everything else keeps
its verification, which is what makes a light post-delivery edit affordable.
