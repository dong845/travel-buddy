"""Regression tests for scripts/start_intake_workflow.py, specifically its --detach mode.

The defect these exist for is not a crash, which is why nothing caught it for so long. The
script's only mode was a blocking subprocess.run(): the intake server prints the traveller's
loopback link, flushes it, and then sits in serve_forever() for the minutes a real person spends
filling a form. Under Claude Code that is fine, because the harness can background the whole
command. Under opencode, Cursor, Cline or Codex there is no background primitive at all, so the
tool call itself holds the link until the harness's command timeout kills the server mid-fill.

The traveller therefore never sees the form -- and every honest exit from that position is
closed. `intake_context.method: html_form` requires the intake file the blocked server never
wrote; `chat_fallback` requires `declined_verbatim`, the traveller's own words declining the
form, which they never said because they were never offered it; and save_trip_deliverables.py
refuses a plan with neither, correctly and with no bypass flag. What is left is to fabricate a
quote or to abandon the save, which is the mechanism by which trip details went unexecuted on
those harnesses.

So the tests below are about a verb, not a rule: --detach must return in seconds with a link
that really answers, must keep the server's later output somewhere the caller can still read it,
and must fail loudly when no server came up -- because a detach that silently produced nothing
is worse than the blocking run it replaces. It reports a link nobody serves, and the traveller
opening it cannot tell that from a form that is merely slow.

The last four cases are about what that verb leaves on disk. Giving the caller the link through a
file instead of a pipe turns the intake server's one-time token -- which its own banner calls the
proof that the page is the one this terminal opened -- into a credential at rest in the
traveller's workspace, beside their profile. The first version wrote it world-readable (measured
at 0644, `-rw-r--r--`), cleared stale files only for the port the current run happened to reserve,
and never removed one at all, so a workspace accumulated a permanent public record of every dead
server it had ever run. That is the same "a link that was never served" failure the cases above
guard against, arriving one port and one run later, through a file rather than through a race --
and it contradicts what SKILL.md's profile rules and references/profile-and-storage.md promise
about local traveller data being written deliberately and narrowly.
