"""Packaging and contract-integrity checks.

The skill ships three ways -- `npx skills add`, the Claude Code plugin manifests, and a plain
clone -- and all three copy the repository as-is. So the things that break installation are not
build errors but drift: a manifest whose versions disagree, a SKILL.md pointing at a file that no
longer exists, a reference file nobody links to (which is the same as deleting it), and a data
contract that omits fields the gates now require.

That last one is what motivated this file. `check_plan_consistency.py` gained required dining and
budget fields, and `templates/final-trip-plan.json` -- the contract people actually copy -- was
not updated with them, so anyone following the template would have walked straight into a failing
gate with no hint why.

# refuse loudly when it names a file that is not there, and the contract said nothing at all. Key
# PRESENCE is all this asserts -- the template's own values are `{}` and `null`, both of which mean

    # 5b. Every `references/<file>.md#<anchor>` a gate can print must resolve to an anchor that

    #     hundred places could refuse a plan and a handful said where the rule was written, which
    #     is what this change is against -- and a citation that
    #     404s is worse than no citation at all: it costs a reader a lookup and then teaches them
    #     that the pointers cannot be trusted, which retires the whole mechanism.
    #
    #     This has to be a test rather than a convention because the two halves drift apart in
    #     silence. Renaming a heading in a reference, or fixing a typo in a rule id, breaks a
    #     pointer that nothing executes: the citation is a string in an f-string, so no import
    #     fails, no gate errors, and the suite stays green while every author who trips that rule
    #     is sent to a fragment that does not exist. The scripts' own tests cannot catch it either
    #     -- they assert on the message, and the message is fine.
    #
    #     Anchors are matched against `<a id="...">` markers rather than against heading slugs on
    #     purpose. A slug is derived from the heading text, so rewording a heading silently moves
    #     it; an explicit id survives every rewording, and the failure mode when someone deletes
    #     one is this test, which is the loud outcome. Both forms are accepted when reading, so a
    #     citation may point at a heading slug -- but nothing does, and nothing needs to.
    #
    #     Scanned as text, not by importing the four gates and reading their registries. Two
    #     reasons: a citation written inline in a message rather than routed through a registry is
    #     still a citation a traveller's author will see, and this test must fail on it too; and
    #     scanning cannot be fooled by a registry entry that no code path can actually emit.
    #
    #     The `references/` prefix is OPTIONAL in this pattern, and that detail is the whole test.
    #     Written as a required prefix first -- which is how the citation reads once printed --
    #     this check passed while `<a id="map-endpoints">` was deleted from booking-html-output.md
    #     and four live citations pointed at nothing. The gates do not store the printed form: the
    #     registries hold `"booking-html-output.md#map-endpoints"` and the f-string supplies
    #     `references/` at call time, so in the SOURCE the two halves are never adjacent and a
    #     pattern anchored on the prefix matched zero of them. It reported success by checking
    #     nothing, which is the exact defect class this repo keeps paying for -- a green gate over
    #     unexamined output -- reproduced inside the test written to prevent it. Hence the floor
    #     below: a scan that finds almost nothing is now a failure rather than a pass.

    #
    #     5c holds check_plan_consistency and check_shortlist_consistency, and it can only hold
    #     them because their citations go on a decorator: the unit is a named function, so a check
    #     that cites nothing is a name missing from a dict and a dict is something a test can read.
    #     render_final_trip_html and validate_trip_html cite on the call instead -- their rules all
    #     live inside one validate() and one parser class, with no per-rule function to decorate --
    #     and that left a hole those files documented in their own comments and could not close:
    #     a new `errors.append("...")` ships uncited and every test stays green. That is the exact
    #     drift this change was made to end, arriving one site at a time through the back door.
    #
    #     So the census is taken from the AST rather than from a registry. Every `<sink>.append(x)`
    #     where x is not a `cite(...)` call is an uncited site, and its enclosing function must be
    #     declared in that module's SITES_WITHOUT_A_REFERENCE with a count.
    #
    #     Why the COUNT and not just the function name. validate_plan() carries 61 uncited shape
    #     rules AND cited map/booking/dining rules in the same body. Exempting the function
    #     wholesale would make it the one place in the repo where a new uncited map rule is
    #     invisible -- the largest function in the largest gate, which is precisely where nobody
    #     would look. Holding the number means a new uncited site there fails here and forces the
    #     decision to be made out loud, which is all the decorator does for the other two files.
    #
    #     Keyed by enclosing function, never by line number: line numbers move on every edit above
    #     them, and a registry that has to be renumbered to stay true will be renumbered wrongly.
    #
    #     The exemption list is checked in BOTH directions. A function that no longer has as many
    #     uncited sites as it claims is reported too -- otherwise the numbers only ever ratchet up,
    #     the dict slowly stops describing the file, and the next person to trust it is misled.
    #     Grepping for `.append(` would not do here and was tried first: it cannot see which
    #     argument is a cite() call, it counts `.append(` inside strings and comments, and it
    #     misses a call split across lines. That is a scan that reports success by matching the
    #     wrong thing, which this file has already shipped once (see the prefix bug in 5b).
