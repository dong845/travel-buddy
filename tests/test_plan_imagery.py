"""Regression tests for scripts/fetch_plan_imagery.py and scripts/plan_visuals.py.

Network-free by construction: every case here exercises the decision logic, which is where all
four of this feature's real defects lived. Whether Wikipedia is reachable is not something a test
suite should assert, but whether a photograph is allowed onto the page is, and that is decided
entirely offline.

The rule these tests defend is that the feature fails CLOSED. A page with three good photographs
and two gaps is honest; a page with five photographs where two are wrong teaches the traveller
that none of the pictures mean anything, and that is worse than the text-only page it replaced.
