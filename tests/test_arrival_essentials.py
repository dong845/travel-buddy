"""The four questions a traveller has walking out of an arrivals hall.

Every other block in a plan is about the days. None of them answered: can I pay, can I get online,
who do I call, am I insured. A page that schedules six days of meals and cannot say whether the
card in the traveller's pocket will work at the first ticket machine has answered the easy half.

The reason this is a *gate* and not a paragraph asking nicely is that these are precisely the facts
that get recalled instead of checked, and recalled wrongly. The case that started it, from a real
plan in the workspace: a Chinese passport holder resident in the Netherlands, flying to Switzerland.
A Dutch EHIC works across the EU. In Switzerland it is worthless to them -- the EU regulation
extending social-security coordination to third-country nationals does not apply to Switzerland,
Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Denmark. Nationality is the only thing separating those two
answers, and nothing in the plan would have asked.

So the tests below are mostly about REFUSAL: the block has to be present, each entry has to have
either a researched answer with a source and a date or an explicit not_applicable WITH a reason,
and a `researched` emergency entry that names no number is refused outright, because that is the
one field in the block somebody dials while something is going wrong.
