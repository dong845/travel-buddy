"""The trip as a calendar, and the one path that gets this plan off the laptop.

Every gate in this skill is about the delivered page being TRUE. None of them was about it being
WHERE THE TRAVELLER IS: a 331 KB local HTML file that nobody can open standing in Lucerne. A
calendar solves that with no server and no account of ours -- the file lands in the traveller's own
calendar and their phone syncs it -- and it carries the two things a page cannot: a time to be
somewhere, and a reminder that fires.

Which makes the file's VALIDITY the whole feature. A calendar a phone refuses to open is worse than
no calendar, because the traveller only finds out at the moment they were relying on it. So most of
this file is RFC 5545 conformance, and the rest is the rule that matters more: it must not invent.

Run:  python tests/test_calendar_export.py
