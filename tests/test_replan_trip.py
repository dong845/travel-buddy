"""Regression tests for scripts/replan_trip.py, driven entirely through the command line.

A date change is the one edit that invalidates researched facts without touching them. Almost
everything under a day is keyed to a WEEKDAY rather than to a date -- opening hours, closure days,
market days, Sunday retail law, a museum that shuts Mondays -- so moving the window by a single day
turns all of it into a guess while the plan still looks complete and still passes every gate. The
measured run that prompted this script did the shift by hand, redid the weekday map from memory,
and introduced an off-by-one in every ticket and every anchor day index.

So the contract has two halves and both are tested here: the script rewrites exactly what a shift
determines (trip and day dates, accommodation windows, dated booking fields, ticket day links) and
rewrites NOTHING else -- prose above all, because "Saturday is the only full shopping day" becomes
false when the dates move and editing the weekday token inside it turns a stale sentence into a
confident lie. Everything it cannot recompute lands in replan_context.must_reverify, where
check_plan_consistency.py refuses the plan until a human resolves each entry.

Every case runs the script as a subprocess. Nothing here imports it, so the tests state the
contract an operator sees and stay true across any rewrite of its internals.
