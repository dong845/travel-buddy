"""A dining card says whether it needs booking, as an enum the calendar's reminder can trust.

The reminder used to be guessed from the queue note: "Book for 12:45 on a Saturday" in the
self-drive fixture got none, and "Reservations not accepted" would have got one.
Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-11-calendar-fixes-design.md.
