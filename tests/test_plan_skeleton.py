"""Regression tests for scripts/new_plan_skeleton.py.

The skeleton earns its place only if it renders on the first try. On the run that motivated it,
the first render of a hand-built plan returned 21 errors and every one was structural — segments
not mirroring stops_in_order by exact string equality, an empty service_or_line on a walking leg,
booking-access categories spelled with the budget enum's words, a departure day with no
breakfast, two flight candidates sharing a review_url. Three edit-render round-trips went into
rediscovering rules a generator can simply obey.

So these tests assert two properties that must both hold, because either one alone is a trap:

  1. the skeleton renders clean, across languages, trip lengths and stop counts; and
  2. the rendered page is still rejected while unfilled, so a faster start never becomes a way
     to ship a hollow itinerary.
