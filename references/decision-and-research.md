# Destination decision, research, and explanation

Use this reference when candidates exist. Perform hard filters before preference scoring and research all final candidates to a comparable level.

## Evidence policy

Treat the following as volatile: fares, routes, lodging prices, weather forecasts and seasonal anomalies, entry rules, health/safety advisories, opening dates/hours, local transport, exchange rates, and event schedules. Verify with live sources, prefer first-party/official sources for entry and safety, and record access date plus travel date range.

If a tool or source is unavailable, say what is unverified. Substitute a range or a decision checklist; do not invent exact prices, availability, or legal eligibility.

## Batch independent lookups

Research calls that do not depend on each other must be issued together, not one after another. Climate normals, direct-route existence, operator timetables, opening hours, ticket prices, and venue checks are all independent of one another; running fifteen of them sequentially spends fifteen round trips to learn what three batches would have returned. Sequence only where a later query genuinely needs an earlier answer — for example, researching a city's restaurants after the shortlist has selected that city.

## Record a place once, in the form the plan will need

Every lookup above is also the only cheap chance to collect what the plan gates will later refuse
to do without, and this is a research rule rather than a formatting one: the alternative is buying
the same page twice.

A venue's own place page carries, in one read, its coordinate pair, the name the map provider
indexes it under, its hours for each weekday, and its rating with the count and the scale. A
property's page on the platform that sells it carries, in one read, the price, whether those exact
dates are sellable, and the guest score. A routing provider's answer carries the leg's real
distance and duration. Write all of them down while the page is open, with the URL you read them
off and the date you read it.

Skip that and the cost lands twice. A candidate that wins the shortlist becomes a plan, and the
plan is refused unless every map endpoint is a coordinate pair, `trip.destination_coords` is
declared, every dining card carries its rating fields beside a verified weekday `hours_status`, and
every accommodation carries its guest score beside a price and an availability that came off the
same page. Meeting that list after the shortlist closes means reopening every page a second time —
and reconstructing from memory is how a 1.1 km seafront walk got written as six minutes, which the
speed rule then rejected.

Three of these have a shape that cannot be recovered afterwards, so get them right at the source:

- **Coordinates, in the provider's own order.** Google, Apple and OpenStreetMap read `lat,lon`;
  Amap reads `lon,lat,name`. Store the raw pair together with which provider's page it came from,
  and never a display label — a caption written into a URL is a geocoder query that resolves
  somewhere else, and one delivered plan's `origin=酒店（拉斯坎特拉斯海滨）` resolved to Taiwan.
  Record the coordinate of every base the trip uses, not only the first: that becomes
  `trip.destination_coords`, one object or a list for a multi-city trip, and it is the only
  absolute reference the endpoint checks have.
- **The rating's scale and count, never the bare number.** Google publishes out of 5; Booking,
  Agoda and TheFork out of 10, so an unlabelled 8.5 is not a claim. 4.8 from 12 reviews and 4.3
  from 2,000 are not the same claim either, which is why the count travels beside the value.
- **Hours for the weekday the visit will actually fall on**, not the venue's general pattern. They
  are keyed to a weekday, so they are also the first thing a date change invalidates.

Quality is evidence here, not taste. A venue below 3.5/5 and a property below 7.0/10 are refused
outright unless the plan says in `rating_below_floor_reason` / `guest_rating_below_floor_reason`
what makes that one worth it anyway — so a candidate whose only affordable lodging is poorly rated
has a scoring problem, and it is cheaper to learn that here than after the destination is chosen.
Read the recent negative reviews of anything you would put a whole week or a farewell dinner on:
an average hides what people were unhappy about, and "a twenty-minute walk from the nearest stop"
disqualifies a traveller with a walking limit while "slow service" does not.

## Evaluation sequence

1. Apply any consented profile’s explicit `never_recommend` place exclusions before candidate generation; do not treat past visits as exclusions unless the user said not to revisit.
2. Create 8–12 geographically and experientially diverse candidates for an open request; create fewer when scope is constrained.
3. Reject candidates that clearly fail a hard constraint. Keep a one-line exclusion log.
4. Research comparable all-in **per-person** trip ranges. Use the same party size, dates/season, night count, category scope, and currency; show any party total only as a separately labeled calculation.
5. Evaluate seasonal fit, transport burden, entry, accessibility, requested natural/cultural subtype, crowd/comfort fit, and confidence in the evidence.
6. Score feasible candidates with user-specific weights. Use a score only as a summary, never the whole explanation.
7. Return 3–5 candidates and invite a decision or one preference refinement. Do not dump the entire research pool unless asked.

If the hard-filtered set is empty, do not calculate a winner. Report the constraint conflict, identify the minimum relaxation likely to restore feasibility, and keep any hypothetical alternatives clearly conditional.

## Suggested scorecard

Allocate weights only across active preferences. A practical starting distribution is:

| Dimension | Starting weight | Adjust when |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Hard-feasibility confidence | gate | Entry, dates, accessibility, flight limit, or budget cap is non-negotiable. |
| Experience fit | 25 | Raise for a focused trip purpose. |
| All-in value | 20 | Raise for strict budget. |
| Seasonal/climate fit | 15 | Raise for weather-sensitive travel. |
| Origin access and local logistics | 15 | Raise for short trips, families, or transfer aversion. |
| Comfort, crowds, food, language, safety | 15 | Activate the user’s stated concerns. |
| Flexibility and evidence confidence | 10 | Raise when dates/prices are uncertain. |

Normalize each soft dimension to 0–100 only after applying the hard gate. State the highest-impact unknowns; low-evidence candidates should be labeled uncertain instead of assigned false precision. An empty feasible set is an outcome, not a scoring error.

## Candidate output contract

For each finalist, provide:

- one-sentence fit statement and confidence;
- comparable all-in per-person budget range, inclusions, currency, and uncertainty; any party total must be separately labeled as derived;
- 2–3 matching reasons tied to user input;
- 1–2 meaningful compromises, risks, or missing evidence;
- primary research sources and access date;
- a ranking sensitivity statement, such as “wins if direct flights stay under X” or “falls behind if heat above Y is unacceptable.”

Then give a recommendation and an honest runner-up. Include selected exclusions when they clarify a material decision: “Removed because entry time is too uncertain,” not “removed because it scored lower.”

## Construction and replan evidence

For a selected destination, keep a dependency record linking each plan element to its assumptions: dates, travelers, origin airport, budget category, mobility, weather, opening hours, and booking state. On a change, recompute only linked elements, but revalidate the total budget and every hard constraint.

Use these booking states precisely:

- `idea`: inspirational, no live check;
- `researched`: current information found, not reserved;
- `held`: temporary reservation or fare hold confirmed by the user;
- `booked`: user has explicitly confirmed the transaction and supplied confirmation details.

Never label an item `booked` because a website displayed it.
